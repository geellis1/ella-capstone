<b>Brief Overview</b>    
ella is a personal health tracker to make living your life more simple. We live in a fast-paced world and keeping track of all that life happily gives us is challenging. Imagine going to a new doctor and having all of your previous health information at your fingertips without having to rack your brain or dig through a file cabinet of old records to try and get one answer. ella is an app that will allow users to keep track of all of their health related information including: 

Doctors Visits
+ Doctor Recommendations from friends
+ Pharmacy Information 
+ Medical History 
+ Prescriptions 
+ Insurance 
+ General Profile (blood type, allergies, weight, height) 

Entries in these different categories will allow the user to easily access information related to their health when needed.
